			<h2>HOW DO I CARE FOR MY LEATHER GOODS?</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>We have specifically chosen leathers that age beautifully over time, and little care is needed. If you would like to condition your English Bridle or Natural Strap leather to re-hydrate it or to jump-start the darkening and softening process, we recommend Neatsfoot Oil or Obenauf’s – a little goes a long way. For Chromexcel leather products, we recommend simply rubbing the leather with a soft cloth or rag to bring out its sheen and to diminish any small scuffs that develop. Chromexcel may exhibit a waxy finish after sitting in transit; this is a natural trait of the specific tanning process, and can easily be dealt with by gently burnishing the item with a cloth. </p>

			<h2>WHAT DOES THE INSPECTION CARD MEAN?</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
	Many of our products involve the work and talents of several of our craftspeople.  The inspection card is a final stamp of approval offered by the last person to handle your order.</p>

	HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO RECEIVE MY ORDER?
	
	Our products are handmade to order by our team of craftsmen here in Portland, Oregon. Due to the nature of our work, we do require a 2-3 week production time. You will receive a shipping confirmation via email once your order has shipped, along with a tracking number.
	 
	CAN I EXPEDITE MY ORDER?
	
	We are working quickly to fulfill orders as soon as possible but unfortunately we are unable to expedite orders at this time.
	 
	CAN I REQUEST A CUSTOM ORDER?
	
	Unfortunately, we are unable to accommodate custom orders at this time, including personalization and embossing.  You may be able to find a local leatherworker who can perform these modifications on a small scale.
	 
	HOW DO I KNOW IF MY ORDER HAS SHIPPED?
	
	When we ship your order, we will send you a confirmation email with a tracking number.  Please note that changes of address will not show up in the confirmation (but if we say we have processed them, we have, don’t worry), and tracking numbers will take up to 24 hours to update.
	 
	WHAT DO I DO IF I NEED TO CHANGE MY ORDER OR SHIPPING INFORMATION?
	
	If you need to change your order or your shipping information, please email us immediately at service@tannergoods.com so we can update your order.  We may or may not be able to make the change, depending on how quickly you get in touch with us, but we will do our best. 
	 
	Please note, our system does not display updated shipping information in shipping-confirmation emails.  If you have gotten in touch with us and we have confirmed that the change has gone through, don’t worry, the address we have is correct even if the email is wrong.
	 
	MY TRACKING NUMBER TELLS ME MY PACKAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DELIVERED – WHAT’S GOING ON?
	
	The USPS reuses tracking numbers.  Within the first 24 hours or so after you receive your shipping confirmation, you may see that your item has already been delivered.  Don’t worry, this is just outdated information from the last time that number was used.  Your correct information should display after 24 hours.  Feel free to contact us at service@tannergoods.com if the issue doesn’t resolve after 36 hours or more.
	 
	WHAT IF THE BELT I ORDERED DOESN’T FIT?
	
	If your belt doesn’t fit, you are welcome to exchange it for another size, or you may return it for store credit.  Because all of our products are made to order, we cannot offer refunds, but hopefully you can find something else to your liking.
	 
	HOW DO I SEND MY ITEM IN FOR A RETURN OR EXCHANGE?
	
	Please contact us about a Return or Exchange within 14 days of receipt of your purchase. Returned items must be in new condition, unworn, with the original tags attached. The customer assumes both the return shipping cost to Tanner Goods and the replacement item shipping cost, unless the item is found to be defective, in which case we will gladly send you a pre-paid shipping label.
	 
	WHY WAS MY ORDER CANCELLED?
	
	This is very unlikely to happen to you, but we do occasionally cancel orders due to shortage of materials or suspicion of fraud.  If we do cancel your order, we will contact you immediately with an explanation.
	 
	WHO DO I CONTACT ABOUT CARRYING TANNER GOODS PRODUCTS IN MY STORE?
	
	If you are interested in becoming a Tanner Goods stockist, please contact jevan@tannergoods.com for more information.</p>
